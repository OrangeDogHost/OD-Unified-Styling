# Orange Dog Unified Style Sheet
## Overview:
This is a child theme for Divi, designed to be automatically deployed, but can be added by simply grabbing the source code .zip from releases and uploading to Wordpress as a theme.

It adds some common theming to reduce the usage of the Divi custom CSS field, and reduce re-doing the same work multiple times.


## Classes:

Any CSS classes that add styling via style.css will be documented here.
